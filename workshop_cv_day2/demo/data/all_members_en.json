Having spent more than a decade in local politics, I have first-hand experience in making that happen. You do not solve problems by incessantly creating new rules, but by grasping the nettle. You have to join forces with the community to come up with a solution together.When I was still a municipal councillor in Amsterdam, I worked with several colleagues to draw up a new education agenda. In the process, we visited more than a hundred schools and spoke to countless teachers, parents and pupils. As a result, all schools in Amsterdam now have a PE teacher, many more janitors, and professional development grants for teachers.Making a differenceI was the first member of my family to go into politics, perhaps because I knew how profound the impact of central government policy on people’s everyday lives could be. My brother went to a special needs school and my mother spent her entire career fighting to improve education for children with learning and behavioural difficulties. At the dining table, we rarely talked about homework alone.At the tender age of 18, I was already an active member of Jonge Democraten, the youth wing of D66. During my time there, I realised that young people also had the power to put big issues on the political agenda, such as a realistic state pension age. Another good example was our countrywide campaign in favour of European cooperation in the wake of the PVV’s anti-Europe campaign back in 2005.Opportunities for allThere are some things that should never be debated. Regardless of whether you are in favour of welcoming refugees with open arms or would prefer them to say ‘in their own region’, refugees who make it here should invariably be given the opportunity to take part in society. Language lessons from day one, in other words, so that they can get a job or start studying for a degree and stand on their own two feet as quickly as possible. Right now, 75% of recent refugees rely on benefits.Climate change is another good example. You will be hard pressed to find a single reputable scientist who will deny global warming nowadays. The Netherlands has a responsibility to lead the way in the transition to clean energy. We have to be able to look our grandchildren in the eye...

I got my first and last name from my Dutch-Indonesian mother, while Feras comes from my Moroccan father. I was born on the first of May 1986 in Brabant and grew up in social housing in the Roosendaal neighbourhood of Westrand. Because I grew up without my father, my mother, together with my grandparents, was responsible for my upbringing at a young age.WishMy future as an MP was never a foregone conclusion. I left the secondary Waldorf school in Prinsenbeek with a vmbo diploma and was told that my dream to study social work at Avans University of Applied Sciences might be out of reach. However, I was also taught that you should never let anyone tell you that something cannot be done.Life lessonWhen I took office as group chairman, I told myself: the only thing standing between you and your dreams is your fear of failure. Let go of that fear, and anything is possible. My mother taught me that life lesson, and I have always found it very important in politics. In the Netherlands, we are promised change every election, only to get more of the same. All parties in power believe in economism: every debate on social matters is flattened into a money issue.ChangeBut the tide is turning. There is an undercurrent in society that is gaining momentum and yearning for change. People who want decisions to be made based on values and ideals, rather than financial concerns. People who refuse to be told that something cannot be done, but believe that almost anything is possible.
